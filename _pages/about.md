I have obtained my PhD from the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/) (NL) working in the group 
of [Prof. Siewert J. Marrink](https://www.rug.nl/research/molecular-dynamics),
home to the [Martini coarse-grained force field](http://cgmartini.nl/). 
Previously, I earned a MSc in Theoretical Chemistry and Computational Modelling
